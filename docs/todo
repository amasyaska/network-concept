TASKS:
#+ 1 is adding try catch block to Hub::add_node() good idea? I think yes
# 2 - implement Hub::remove_node()
#+ 3 - implement unique addresses for every network node
	- implement object to "register" nodes (I dont think using address as a field in object is safe enough, because maybe somehow one object will be able to change it's address thus will be able to get not their own requests.)
#+ 4 - implement Hub class to register nodes.
	- Hub class is a container for Nodes

# 5 - implement Client class as a descendant of Node
	- update documentation
# 6 - implement Server class as a descendant of Node
	- update documentation
# 7 - does container contain pointer to constant?
# 8 - throw exception in Node::get_hub
