TASKS:
# 1 - implement unique addresses for every network node
	- implement object to "register" nodes (I dont think using address as a field in object is safe enough, because maybe somehow one object will be able to change it's address thus will be able to get not their own requests.)
# 2 - implement Hub class to register nodes.
	- Hub class is

CLASSES:
Hub:
	is a container for nodes


FUNCTIONS:

PROBLEMS:
- how to identify every node of a network?
	when we are getting a task to send request, a problem arises: where? thus, we need to identify nodes somehow. I suggest to use addresses (amoa).
- do we have to set unique addresses for every node of a network? I think yes.
